make an API endpoint that returns Spotify's last 50, for a web widget
	Connect app with oAuth hosting an admin page
	Serve as a get endpoint via https

make a database of each song/listen/date 
	calculate top 40 by week
	maybe poll servers every 10 minutes? Can it work via push?
	make a database for holding

make a task manager class that makes a schedule:
	manage Spotify account auth token refresh calls
	automatically call /last50 for each user in db every 25 minutes 
		(must be at least 30s per song for Spotify to count it as played, 50songs*30seconds = 25 mins)

set up https on server

	
set up a button to make a playlist of your recent history (if you've noticed you've been rocking out for a while) - accidental banger mixtape button 

future: 
	Maybe host a site that does this for people?
